# Varun Parekh's Very Own User Page 

Picture of myself 


## Introduction 

My name is Varun Parekh, I was born in India, grew up in the UAE and now live here in San Diego. 

I am a third year **Math-CS** major at **Revelle Collge, _The First and Finest college_**. 

I enjoy playing sports like football <sup>Arsenal</sup> ~~soccer~~, badminton and basketball <sub>Lebron is the GOAT</sub>.

I love going on roadtrips, hiking, taking photos, reading books and history. 

***If I was to describe myself as a programmer with a quote***

>“I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.” -Bill Gates

***Or if I was to write it as a piece of code***

```
boolean codingSuccessful(){
if(coffeeDrank){
return true;
}
else{
return false;
}
}
```

I also like taking photos of scenery and other things when I am bored or travelling.
